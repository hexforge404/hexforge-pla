# HexForge Portable Lab Assistant (PLA)

**Internal-only lab tool**: Camera vision ("eyes") + bounded HID executor ("hands") + AI assistant ("brain") with confirm-to-execute guardrails.

> ⚠️ **SAFETY FIRST**: This tool executes keyboard/mouse actions. Physical kill switch required. Use only on authorized, operator-owned systems.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Understand the system**: Read [Project Charter](docs/00_PROJECT_CHARTER.md) and [Architecture](docs/01_ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. **Review safety**: Read [Safety Guardrails](docs/02_SAFETY_GUARDRAILS.md) and [Threat Model](docs/10_THREAT_MODEL.md)
3. **Gather hardware**: See [Hardware BOM](docs/04_HARDWARE_BOM.md)
4. **Build it**: Follow setup guides (Brain, Camera, HID Executor)
5. **Test thoroughly**: Run [Test Plans](docs/08_TEST_PLANS.md) - **all safety tests must pass**
6. **Operate safely**: Use [Runbooks](docs/09_RUNBOOKS.md) for daily operations

## Operating Modes

| Mode | Camera | AI Suggestions | HID Execution | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| **Observe** | ✓ Active | ✗ Disabled | ✗ Disabled | Learning, monitoring |
| **Suggest** | ✓ Active | ✓ Enabled | ✗ Disabled | Evaluate AI suggestions |
| **Execute** | ✓ Active | ✓ Enabled | ✓ Approved actions only | Assisted workflows |

**Default mode**: Observe (safest)

## Core Safety Features

- ✅ **Physical kill switch** - Hardware power interrupt to HID executor
- ✅ **HID ARMED LED** - Visible indicator when execution enabled
- ✅ **Confirm-to-execute** - Every action requires explicit approval
- ✅ **Command bounds** - Max 1024 chars, rate limited (100ms)
- ✅ **Session logging** - Immutable audit trail of all actions
- ✅ **Smart brain, dumb hands** - AI logic separated from execution

## Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Smart Brain, Dumb Hands
- All reasoning happens in the Brain
- HID executor is a simple, bounded device
- No autonomous decision-making in HID firmware

### 2. Confirm-to-Execute by Default
- Observe-only and Suggest-only modes available
- Execute mode requires explicit approval for each action
- No batch execution without individual approvals

### 3. Full Visibility and Control
- Physical kill switch (hardware power interrupt)
- HID ARMED LED (visible indicator)
- Session logging (immutable audit trail)

### 4. Lab Safety First
- No payloads or exploits
- No bypassing OS security
- No privilege escalation
- No interaction with non-owned machines
